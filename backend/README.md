## Important Notes

### Position Management
- **Unique Constraints:** Each list must have unique position within a board, each card must have unique position within a list
- **Auto-positioning:** If position not provided, items are added to the end
- **Manual positioning:** If position is provided, it must be unique or will result in constraint error
- **Frontend Responsibility:** Frontend should handle position reordering and gap management

### Date Format
Use ISO 8601 format for dates: `"2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z"`

### Cascade Deletes
- Deleting a user ‚Üí deletes all their boards ‚Üí deletes all lists ‚Üí deletes all cards
- Deleting a board ‚Üí deletes all its lists ‚Üí deletes all cards in those lists
- Deleting a list ‚Üí deletes all its cards
